1. INTRODUCTION
   ============================================================

## 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the complete functional
and non-functional requirements of the SkillBridge application
with detailed user stories, validations, and acceptance criteria.

This SRS serves as:

* A development reference document
* A testing and validation baseline
* An interview explanation artifact
* A blueprint for enterprise-style system design

---

## 1.2 Scope

SkillBridge is a web-based full-stack application that allows users
to track job applications, interview rounds, outcomes, and notes.

The system provides:

* Secure user authentication and authorization
* Job application lifecycle management
* Interview round tracking
* Dashboard analytics
* CI/CD integration and code quality enforcement

---

## 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations

JWT  : JSON Web Token
RBAC : Role-Based Access Control
CRUD : Create, Read, Update, Delete
CI/CD: Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
API  : Application Programming Interface
DTO  : Data Transfer Object
SRS  : Software Requirements Specification

============================================================
2. OVERALL DESCRIPTION
======================

## 2.1 Product Perspective
